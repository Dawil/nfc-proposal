						<p>Imagine a BVN-DH hosted seminar on architecture styles in
						Sydney. There is a guest speaker giving the talk, a Futurum
						co-ordinator and around 15 BVN-DH employees attending, expecting
						to recieve Futurum credits.</p>
						<p>The Futurum co-ordinator needs to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Identify every BVN-DH employee attending,</li>
							<li>Send every attendee an email with the relevant Epicor
							code and a link to a comprehension quiz,</li>
							<li>Grade and log the results of every comprehension quiz
							attempted.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="link-heading" id="how_it_looks">How it looks</h2>

						<p>All the Futurum participants are given a special
						Futurum card. All the Futurum co-ordinators are given an
						app on their smartphones.</p>

						<p>When a participant arrives at a seminar they present
						their card to the co-ordinator who uses the app to read
						it.</p>

						<p>This automatically logs the attendance of the
						participant.<p>

						<p>The system then sends the attending participants a comprehension
						quiz to be completed for bonus points after the seminar.</p>

						<p>Finally, both the participant and the final quiz score
						for every participant is available in a human and
						computer readable format. This allows the co-ordinator to
						share the score with the participant and Futurum to log
						the result and award points to participants.</p>

						<h3>Similar Systems</h3>
						<p>The experience would be similar to the video <a
							href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUqZYcAnUlw">below</a>.</p>

					<section>
						<h2 class="link-heading" id="how_it_works">How it works</h2>

						<p>There are three parts to this proposal:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									The creation and distribution of NFC cards for each Futurum
									participant,
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The creation of an Android NFC reader App for use by the
									Futurum co-ordinators,
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									A Futurum gmail account which will be used by the app to log
									attendance and quiz scores in Google Document files, as well
									as send out emails.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="link-heading" id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

						<p>There are many benefits to this approach. The important ones are:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Low friction</dt>
							<dd>The process of logging attendance is painless for both the
							participant and the co-ordinator.</dd>

							<dt>Reduced errors</dt>
							<dd>By logging attendance with the NFC card and app we lessen the
							burden on the co-ordinator. Getting somebody's email wrong or
							forgetting to email a comprehension quiz are both impossible with
							this system.</dd>

							<dt>Cloud based</dt>
							<dd>Using Google Docs means our data is stored in the cloud. This
							removes the need for extensions to existing BVN-DH
							infrastructure.</dd>

							<dt>Automation</dt>
							<dd>By logging the data in a computer friendly format in Google
							Docs we are able to automatically perform operations on the data
							as it comes in. For example, <a
								href="http://www.flubaroo.com/">Flubaroo</a> is a free and open
							source script that will automatically grade the results of Google
							Docs spreadsheets.  Because our data is automatically recorded we
							can also automatically grade the results, getting useful
							statistics and potentially even presenting these back to the
							participant as a report card.</dd>
						</dl>

					<section>
						<h2 class="link-heading" id="costs">Costs</h2>
						<p>In order to create this system there are some costs involved.</p>

						<h3>NFC Cards</h3>
						<p>An NFC card needs to be designed, printed and written to for each
						BVN-DH employee that will participate in Futurum. NFC cards are
						relatively modern but are fairly cheap to produce in the quantities
						we'll be working with.</p>

						<h3>Android App</h3>
						<p>An Android app needs to be developed to read NFC cards and send
						the result to a Google Spreadsheet. Such an app would be very simple
						in scope compared to most other Android apps. It's users would all
						be Futurum co-ordinators and all the parts to do with storing the
						results in Google Docs has already been tested by the QR Reader
						prototype.</p>

						<h3>Google Docs</h3>
						<p>Although side of the system has already been implemented it would
						be best to move it onto a Futurum Google Apps account instead of the
						private account it's currently on. If a Futurum Google Apps account
						does not already exist they can be <a
							href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_au/enterprise/apps/business/pricing.html">
							cheaply purchased</a> for $5/user/month. The users would only be
						Futurum co-ordinators, or possibly only the single account for all
						of the Futurum documents.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="link-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
						<p>A method has been proposed for logging the attendance of BVN-DH
						employees attending Futurum seminars. In addition it also manages
						the emailing and grading of related comprehension quizes. It does
						this by reading identifying information on NFC enabled cards
						provided to BVN-DH employees participating in Futurum and automatically
						sending the data to a cloud storage. The proposed system is simple
						and composed of cheap components and works nicely with other task
						automation tools.
